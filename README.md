## About Me:
I’m a software engineer and educator with experience building full-stack applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, and SQL/NoSQL databases and have a special interest in Web Accessibility.

I’ve mentored and taught hundreds of students through project-based learning, code reviews, and debugging, while also designing and maintaining websites for clients. I care about writing clear, maintainable code, building accessible web experiences, and staying current with modern tools and frameworks. 

Before working in tech, I served 20 years in the U.S. Army, where I learned persistence, adaptability, and how to work well with any team.
