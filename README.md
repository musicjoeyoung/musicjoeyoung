## About Me:
  As a software engineer and graduate of the Fullstack Academy
            Software Engineering Immersive program, I love to problem-solve,
            design, debug, test, and build various types of applications.
            I&apos;m passionate about learning and implementing web
            accessibility standards into everything I do.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have helped build and deploy efficient and user-friendly marketing
            campaigns for hundreds of major companies, a performance marketing
            channel that delivers one-to-one messages across email and text at
            an unmatched scale.
            <br />
            <br />I have also collaborated on both e-commerce websites with full
            user-authorization structures and attractive user interface, as well
            as interactive, multi-user web spaces with polished front-end
            designs.
I'm a software engineer and graduate of the Fullstack Academy Software Engineering Immersive program. I perform coding, debugging, testing, and troubleshooting in application development processes. I work primarily in Javascript with HTML5, CSS3, React, Redux, Node, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Babel, Webpack, OAuth, Heroku. I have also earned certifications from MIT on EdX.org in Data Science with Python.
