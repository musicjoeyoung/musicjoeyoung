## About Me:
I'm a software engineer with multiple years of experience coding, debugging, testing, and troubleshooting in application development processes. I work primarily in Javascript & TypeScript with HTML, CSS, SASS, React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, jQuery, MongoDB, Zod, Drizzle, NextJS and have a special interest in Web Accessibility.

I design and manage websites for a number of clients. In addition to graduating from Fullstack Academy's Intensive Immersion program, I have also earned certifications in Data Science with Python from MIT via EdX.org.

I have helped build and deploy efficient and user-friendly marketing campaigns for hundreds of major companies for a performance marketing channel that delivers one-to-one messages across email and text. I have also collaborated on both e-commerce websites with full user-authorization structures and attractive user interface, as well as interactive, multi-user web spaces with polished front-end designs.
